# mimo-challenge

## Notes

- This is the MVP for the code challege. Some of the instructions were unclear so I tried my best
to interpret what you meant in the instruction
- I was unsure on how the color object was suppose to be implemented so I used it as the background color
- I figured the input desired for Lesson 7 was "number" so the button is disabled unless that string is
entered
- I think there might be some typos with the example lesson in the README instructions. I think the
answer in to the examples lesson is "print" instead of "World", but it might just be my misinterpretation
- If the code challenge required more components I would have used redux to manage states and refrain from
the React lifecycle methods as much as possible because I don't think they are that reliable
- I stored the lesson completion data as states in App.js. I'm unsure if that's what you meant in your
instructions or if you wanted me to create a simple backend for a database. Since this was a frontend
challenge I decided to not use any backend tools.
- I also spent no time on styling so I apologize for the appearance...
